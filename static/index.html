                <h4>Security & Privacy</h4>
                <p>
                    This service has no long-term persistence mechanism for
                    data. The last 1500 lines of request logs are kept to aid in
                    keeping the service working. These lines are stored
                    securely in Heroku. No other logging or storage is
                    configured.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unsubscription must be done from a notification, as this
                    sercive has no knowledge about active subscriptions.
                </p>

                <h4>About this service</h4>
                <p>
                    This service is run for free as a convenience. It is used
                    by the engineering team at
                    <a href="https://thread.engineering/">Thread</a> and will
                    be maintained for the forseeable future, but no guarantees
                    about uptime are made. Statuspage will fall back to email
                    notifications should webhook delivery fail.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The service was built by
                    <a href="https://danpalmer.me/">Dan Palmer</a> with Nginx
                    and Lua.
